 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  The growing number of discussions on political issues and other issues on social networks
  result in the polarization of those messages, considering the characteristics 
  of the content selection algorithms used in these platforms. Therefore,
  the ``Cidade Democr√°tica'' institute presents the idea of a new social participation 
  platform, the ``Pushing Together'', to be used in web and mobile applications.
  The idea is to allow the user to create and participate of conversations, performing 
  comments and/or votes on a comment of another participant. With the given votes, people 
  who answered in a similar way are grouped, allowing the user to get a wide 
  vision of all opinions. The user grouping use the clustering method and it is the only
  module currently in development on the platform.
  Violence against women is another popular discussion issue highlighted nowadays, due to
  the increasing number of women homicide victims and the search 
  for informations about that type of violence. These facts boosted the creation of public policies
  to reduce this type of violence and to increase population awareness.
  Furthermore, we discuss in this work that
  applications and sites were created to help on information divulgation and
  data and statistics collection about this type of violence.
  However, a tool with the focus on effective discussions about this theme was not found. 
  Considering the `` Pushing Together '' goals and needs, and also this gap identified on
  the plataforms of support to women victims of violence, 
  the goal of this study is to present a service proposal, an API, for the `` Pushing Together ''
  platform and evaluate it, evolving it to use in platforms that aims to support women victims of violence.
